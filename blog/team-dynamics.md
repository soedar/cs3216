This week, Jim shared with us his CS3216 story. I think it is quite interesting to hear his struggles about getting the project off the ground, the constant back and forth between deciding what to do, and having to manage and deal with the influence of others who have no real stake in the project. Despite the challenges that they have faced, they still managed to produce a reasonable product, in time for the project showcase under a tight deadline. I think it goes to show that with grit, a high tolerance of pain, and insufficient sleep, it is definitely possible to make something out.

He posed the following 3 questions for reflection:

1. How much control and authority would you have given to this fourth voice in our choice of platform (HTML5 / native iOS)
I would like to draw the parallel between this fourth voice and the people that usually play the role of advisors in startups. Often times, the teammates in a startup might be lacking in certain expertise, and would thus seek the help of advisors (people with domain knowledge and other commitments) to help.

However, in the case of Jim and his team, it seems foolish to not play to the individual strength of the team members. Already shorthanded with only one developer, the developer should be taking charge of the technical aspect of the project. 

2. With the deadline just 2 weeks away, how would you, as project manager, resolve this problem if it were to occur within the team?
Although the obvious solution seem to be to decide on one technology and *start building something already*, we should consider a little into the team dynamics and personalities at this point. Every hour that *the decision* was delay necessary means that there would be higher responsibility on the person who actually make the call should the decision turn out to not be a good one. At this point, the pressure of making the wrong decision is so high that it creates an even bigger inertia into making the decision.

If I were the project manager in this situation, I would work to reduce the features of the product to its bare minimum, the absolute minimum that would be enough to show the idea of the project. I would elaborate on what that imply shortly.

3. What are some of the issues that we presented that could have happened to any team? List down 3, and talk about how you would have resolved these issues.

    1. The lack of clear roles and delegation of responsibilities in the team. It seems like the roles and responsibility of the members overlapped. There should be one final decision maker, who will make the final call regarding all aspect of the project, and would take responsibility of that decision. It is up to the team members with their expertise (be it business, technical) to convince said decision maker of the decision to be made. The solution would be to explicitly make the role of the decision maker clear at the start of any project.

    2. Inertia in making decision. Decisions should be made quickly, so that the flaws of the decisions made would be uncovered early. This increases the chance of course correction if the decision turns to be made badly. Talking about the pros and cons of a technology stack is pointless; you will not truly know how the stack fit into your project. Build a mini prototype that demonstrate ONE key idea of your project in BOTH stack, and the problems that you will encounter will be obvious quickly. At the very least, you will still have something to build on top off when you decide on your stack.

    3. Not playing to the strength of the team. Often times, we come up with good ideas that we cannot accomplish and finish. I myself have fallen into this trap once. A good idea given to the wrong team is worse that an average idea executed by a suitable team. No matter how good your idea is, if you cannot execute, you will not do a good job (or suffer immensely). I don't think that they should have attempted a technical centric idea with only one developer in the team.


# Minimum viable product?

I've recently read an article, but unfortunately lost the article (will continue to find it and update this post). The central thesis of the post is that we are too fixated with building a minimum working product, than we spend too much time trying to wrestle with the technology and forget what is important: whether people will use it or not. Instead, the article suggests (backed by examples from several startups) that an MVP can be as simple as a landing page to gauge the interest in the idea, and that features can be implemented mechanical Turk style.

This goes back to playing to the individual strengths of each member. Teams should evaluate the strengths of each individual member, and come up with a project that each member could play a fulfilling role. To me, the project seems to be too technical to be executed by a team without much technical people, and hence it would not even be attempted. 

Although it would definitely be a big risk in this class to simply demo a static landing page, I believe that the traction that they would have gotten for a less technical idea would be more than make up for the lack of technical prowess. Sure, you might have built a product that is functional and looks nice, but *my* project already have 10 paying customers who already bought our tour packages with just a landing page.
