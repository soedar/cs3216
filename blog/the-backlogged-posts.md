I was late in my reflections. I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to say what I want to say, and in a typical fashion, have procrastinated till now to complete my blog posts. Better late than never, right?

# The Pitch - 23rd September 2013
Like what Prof Ben has said, it is incredibly difficult to come up with a completely original idea that no one has thought about. In fact, if no one has done it, it should be treated as a warning sign, as there could be some underlying problem with the idea. It should comes as no surprise that most of the ideas pitched were not original, and were attempted by even earlier batches of students taking CS3216. 

I do believe, however, that timing plays a more crucial role in tilting success rate of an idea. Choosing the right time to execute an idea is more important than be completely original. However, having said that, determining when is the right time can be tricky business. It would definitely take foresight, an understanding of the market conditions, as well as some luck, to be able to execute an idea well.

Seems like the idea that we pitched was relatively well received by most. I'm particularly annoyed by someone who seems to be playing the role of a bad guy and just being a jerk about most of the ideas that were pitched. If he wasn't acting, then I guess that says quite a bit about his personality too.

# Assignment 3
Clearly, I did not do a good job for assignment 3. I felt that my incompetence have let the team down, and as a result we have delivered a substandard product. There are definitely things that could have done better, but in some cases, I felt that there are fundamental differences in the working style of our team.

My role in the project is on the frontend, specifically client-side code sans the design stuff. It is a role that I have no experience in, but one that I wish to find out more and learn about. Our chosen framework, AngularJS, was not particular difficult to learn, but was extremely difficult to master. It is incredibly easy to fall into the trap of simply hacking things together, and I guess I spent too much time trying to make sure I wasn't hacking, trying to learn the 'correct' way of doing things. Being not familiar with the paradigm slowed me down quite a lot, and I ended up trying to change how things work instead of embracing the new way. 

As I would have to make RESTFul calls to the backend, and render the output on the frontend, I was writing code that was in between the two. At times, I was not sure if the issues while making the calls were due to my inaptitude with the frontend framework or simply bugs on the backend. I have spent more time that I would like to admit trying to resolve issues on the frontend side, only to realize that issues on the backend were causing the errors. Although my team members were clearly competent, bugs inevitably would appear from time to time, and when they do, I would spend time trying to resolve them on the backend.

I feel a more crucial issue that we were facing is the difference in the working style of our teammates. Throughout the assignment, we have mainly relied on virtual communications through Google Hangout. I am not comfortable with working virtually, and I am finding that having a physical presence with my team helps me focus and resolve issues more quickly. As a result, I feel extremely ineffective for the most part of the project. 

It is definitely not an excuse for performing poorly. But to me, it shows how important it is to build a team around people with the same working style as you, for everyone to be able to perform at their peak. Or well, maybe I need to practice working more independently from now on too. Either way, I have learned a lesson from this experience.
