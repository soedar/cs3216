I am excited to go back to school. Having spent one year abroad on my internship, I can finally understand and appreciate what some people meant when they said that when you are working, you would wished that you are still in school studying. The school is a more forgiving place, and having the label of a "student" means that you probably can make the kind of mistakes that people will understand. 

My goals for CS3216 is not be afraid of making mistakes, and to experiment and try new things. So far, I have been taking relatively safe routes, prefering to make as little mistakes as possible. As the saying goes, a ship is safest when it is at port, however that is not what a ship is intedend for. I would like to set sail on rough waters and gain experience. 

The stalker in me have looked through the profile of some of the students taking the course, and I am both impressed and slightly intimidated. Some of the students taking the course are leads on various projects that are already used by many people. Prof Colin wasn't lying when he said that some students are probably experts in the topics that would be covered in the workshop. Yet I am truly excited to have the opportunity to work with these talented and accomplished individuals. 

Although I have some experience developing applications, I did not have the opportunity to really publish, obtain feedback from other users, and iterate the application. I believe that there would definitely be opportunity to bring our future CS3216 project into the real world, and I would definitely like to work in projects where there are potential to be brought to the real world.

Really looking forward to move fast and break things this semester. Should be fun.
