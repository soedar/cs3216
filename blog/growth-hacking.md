I'm not so sure about growth hacking.

Sure, the basic concept is fairly simple; the use of non conventional (and often really cheap) approach to try and get as many people to use your product as possible. And thanks to Bjorn Lee's talk, I now know some clever tricks to 'convince' people to try my new product.

In his talk, there were a lot of emphasis on marketing, app store ranking, and how he managed to get a seemingly large number of users, high download counts and high chart rank for his products. The things that I thought were missing form his talk, was the quality of the products and the retention rate of his hacks. Granted, he was presenting about how to drive people to download and try your product; but I personally believe in the correlation between good products and growth. If you are building a consumer facing application, you simply cannot have sustained growth with shitty products, no matter how hard you try.

With the explosion of apps in the App Store, it might seem like it is important to make it up on the various charts in order for others to be able to discover your product. What started out (probably) as an objective measure on how good a product is based on its popularity is now polluted by not so good products by publishers that have found a loophoop in the charting algorithms. In some sense, I am quite glad that the last frontier on how good a product is (Staff's Choice, which by its name suggests that it probably is curated by Apple's employees) not yet breached.

Getting on the charts is no big deal. Run an Adword Campaign, and with sufficient money, you probably will get on the charts. Not willing to part with the money? I think that says a lot about the quality of your product and what you think about it. 

The problem, as it always have been, is that products are not as good as they can be. We need more product people, passionate people who have a vision of what a product should be and its value to its intended audience. We need more engineers, who can carry out the vision of the product guys by building a well polished and solid product that can convey these values to audience. We need good products, not good salesmen.

Your user base should grow because your product is good, not because you mucked around with it.

PS: I had fallen for the deals trick. There was a post about how some paid games are now free (PvZ 2 was at the top of the list), and out of curiousity I downloaded another game on the list that had a fancy name that I thought was cool. I deleted that game within 5 minutes of opening it.
