#Interesting observations from the Yelp presentation

1. Breaking the Digital Wall for Consumer Retention
One thing that stood out from the Yelp presentation is that they seem to be the only few company that have spent a significant amount of time reaching out to users and building an active community. Companies usually do not have such direct and physical connection with their users, and the fact that Yelp did it and has success with it is pretty interesting. In particular, learning more about the Yelp Elite program is an interesting approach to build community amongst its users.

2. Breaking the Digital Wall for Consumer Acquisition
It is often difficult for a startup to gain traction and for others to know what product that the startup is selling. Many companies are incredibly focused on acquiring a digital presence, often purchasing banner advertisements and joining advertisement network to reach their intended audience. It is interesting to hear about a non-digital approach to acquire customers, such as providing restaurants with stickers and including Yelp mailer in the envelopes. 

3. Monetization after gaining user base
One interesting pattern, especially in Silicon Valley startup, is a trend to go as large as possible before even thinking about monetization. There are definitely several success stories that followed this model; Facebook; Twitter; and Instagram. Yelp is seemingly following this model, as it is still pretty unclear what their monetization strategy is, despite having a large user base. Their strategy of "Get Big First" is probably not employed much in Singapore.

The group didn't really discuss the UI/UX aspect of the Yelp application, and it wasn't clear from the presentation what exactly Yelp is. 

#My Thoughts
I think that not enough companies try hard enough to maintain a physical presence with their customers. I feel that going offline is instrumental to help build brand loyalty and brand awareness. I am fairly certain that the "Get Big First" model will not work in Singapore; we are just not big enough. 

In addition, making users feel valued with a seemingly simple act of meeting up with the local chapter of Yelpers would definitely create brand loyalty among its users. I feel breaking the digital wall was a significant factor in its explosive growth.

As a crowd sourced review site that started off in the Food and Beverage industry, having a physical presence in the highly rated restraints is a brilliant move. By offering banner stickers for highly rated location helps increase awareness and credibility in the Yelp brand; if Yelp knows that this restraint that I like is pretty good, it probably knows other good restraints that I do not know. 

As a more risk adverse society, projects that have no clear business model are unlikely to get any funding. In addition, it is unlikely for a product to monetize well after gaining a large share of the market, as the market in Singapore is relatively small. Products that have successfully monetize after getting big typically utilize the reach of their application in order to monetize (for instance, advertisers are only interested in Twitter after they have acquired a large user base, because there is a potential to reach a large amount of targeted users).
